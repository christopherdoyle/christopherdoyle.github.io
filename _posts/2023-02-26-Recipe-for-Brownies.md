## Ingredients

* 100 g unsalted butter
* 175 g caster sugar
* 75 g dark muscovado sugar
* 150+ g dark chocolate
* 1 tbsp golden syrup
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
* 100 g plain flour
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1/2 tsp salt

## Method

1.  Gently melt butter with most of the chocolate (100--125 g) and the
syrup in a double boiler.<span class="marginnote">Melting directly in a pan should work but this can split sometimes.</span>
Once melted allow to cool to room temperature.
Chop the remainder of the chocolate into small pieces.

2. Grease a 20 cm (8 in) shallow square cake tin and line the base.
Preheat an oven to 170 Â°C.
3. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder into a bowl with
a pinch of salt.
4. Once the butter and chocolate is mostly cooled, start beating together the
   eggs, flavouring, and sugar with a whisk. This should take 5--10 minutes, we
   want to incorporate some air.

5. Fold the cooled chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, then sift
in the flour mixture. Stopping mixing when no streaks of flour

remain, but do not overmix, a rough mixture is good. Finally fold
in the chopped pieces of chocolate from earlier.
6. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 25 minutes
until the top is crisp and the edge of the cake is beginning to
shrink away from the tin.
7. Leave the cake to cool completely in the tin then cut into squares to serve.
